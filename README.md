## 🔍 Analysis & Insights
- **Morning sales are weak** → only 107 invoices (lowest volume).  
- **Evening has highest average bill value**, even though order counts are similar to lunch.  
- **Wednesday leads in total sales**, while **Tuesday, Saturday, and Sunday lag behind**.  
- Only **5 days exceeded 2000 EGP**, while **18 days dropped below 1000 EGP**.  
- **July 2nd** was the strongest day with **7,932 EGP in sales**.

## 💡 Recommendations
- **Target low-demand periods** (morning & off-peak hours) with discounts, combos, or special offers.  
- **Run weekday promotions** (especially Tuesday, Saturday, Sunday) to balance weekly performance.  
- **Adjust staffing schedules** to match demand patterns → more staff during peaks, fewer during quiet hours.  
- **Focus evening promotions** on upselling higher-value meals, since bill size is naturally higher.  
- **Expand delivery/online offers** during low footfall hours to boost sales.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Automate analysis using **Power BI** or **Tableau** dashboards.  
- Apply **Python & Pandas** for deeper statistical insights and forecasting.  
- Incorporate **customer segmentation** if detailed data becomes available.
